TB next Gen
Overview from HE perspective
  TB Mean mode started by HE (when mode = armed-night or armed-away)
    and HSM signals intrusion or by Testing Switch - 
      If not recogized: Does 'who is' conversation, pick the talk/music path
----> if recognized stop/cancel, 
    Music path: trumpy.py:begin_intruder() (steps 1,2,3)
      1. homie/trumpy_enable/switch/state turned on 
        That is HE: Trumpy Enable Switch - which Fires 'Trumpy Music' rule (RM)
      2. "Trumpy Music" plays the music, 
          Sets Cops Arrive Switch, 
    Talk path: trumpy.py:begin_mycroft() (1 and 3)
      1. sets 2m timer. when it expires:
          Turns on Cops Arrive Switch - /homie/trumpy_cops/switch/state
---->      NEED TO do this.
      3. Cops Arrive Switch + Rule
          turns alarm lights on
          plays arrive chime - mac mini issue
          
Where to use Lasers?
          

At startup, go into 'tame' mode.
HE/HSM can can turn it into 'mean' mode via 'You're Fired' switch

Login and Register - Touch Panel App (Shoes) 
done: login - using face - can turn off alarms, play with lasers
     request HE to turn on light.
     request TB to do login face recog.
done:  HE [Alexa] can start a 'registration' (TB Register Switch)
      a. sends homie/trumpy_bear/screen/control/set  {"cmd": "register"}
      b. Shoes app cmd/register,  
        request HE to turn on light
        replaces Login panel with registration panel
        asks homie/trumpy_bear/control/cmd {"cmd": "register"} 
      c. TB sends {cmd: user, user: xxx, role: x}
      d. shoes confirms and if yes
        replace panel with login panel
done: 'Trumpy Register Switch' and mqtt-driver - puts Shoes.app in registration mode
      which puts TB in register mode.
      which sets Trumpy Active Switch
      
done: Your Fired' switch - starts trumpy bear in mean mode. 
      Should Motion event trigger it?  For Demo/Test purposes. 
        
done: 'Trumpy Active' switch - controls Yamaha, Trumpy Lamp via Trumpy Busy Rule.
      turns on switch when recieves 'awake' on homie/trumpy_bear/screen/control
      from Shoes. Turns off with 'sleep' sleep message
      
done: 'Trumpy Busy" RULE - lights on/off, mute/unmute when 'Trumpy Active' is set
    
Turning OFF TB  when it's in Mean Mode:
  HSM started Trumpy Bear - we need to stop the bear stuff and
  get HSM disarmed 
  HSM enable/disable is button oriented.

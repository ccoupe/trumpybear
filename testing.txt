Daily task: processes are responding to Application checks&pings:
    mosquitto server responding
    bt connected to speaker
    mycroft bridge
    mycroft process responding
    trumpybear process responding
    login process responding
    zmqtracker - something simple?
    turrents - process responding
 
 
Python Program - probably using flask for web pages
Manual Health/Debug/Show-Off:
  Camera stream via Zmqtracker
  Mycroft - send mycroft a textual question
  Turret checks - do a zig zag with laser on

Currently when TB sends the first frame to a zmqtracker it
  publishes a mqtt message to a kodi topic or a panel topic
  When kodi or the front panel send an http request for a mjpeg
  The zmqtracker starts feeding the queue (which is drained by
  the mjpeg process)
  
  Note:  the choice of kodi or front panel is from a previous
  mqtt sent to the tracker.

  Here is a nicer version - assuming it works.
  https://github.com/0rtis/multithread-http-server
  
  
  The 'chosen' zmq produces up to N number of streams/queues
    1. Kodi 
    2. Login panel
    3. A demo/test program 
  Any combination 
  Should pass
